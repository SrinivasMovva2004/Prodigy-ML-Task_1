House Price Prediction Model

This repository contains a simple machine learning model to predict house prices based on square footage, number of bedrooms, and number of bathrooms. The model is implemented using Python and utilizes the scikit-learn library for machine learning tasks.

Dataset:
The dataset used in this project is synthetic and consists of the following columns:
1.House_Price: Target variable (in dollars)
2.Square_Footage: Area of the house in square feet
3.Num_Bedrooms: Number of bedrooms in the house
4.Num_Bathrooms: Number of bathrooms in the house
5.The dataset is generated programmatically and saved as a CSV file (your_dataset.csv) for demonstration purposes.

Requirements:
Make sure you have the following libraries installed:
pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
matplotlib

Files:
-Task_1.ipynb: Python script containing the model training, evaluation, and visualization code.
-your_dataset.csv: CSV file containing the generated dataset used for training and testing.
